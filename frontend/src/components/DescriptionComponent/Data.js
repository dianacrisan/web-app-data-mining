    description: 'Today, the Internet offers endless possibilities for individuals to acquire or distribute data. The amount of information that is available online is immense and since there is so much data at our disposal, programmers and researchers have come up with several techniques that can be applied so that this data can be restructured, in order for individuals to process it and draw insights from it. The field that is associated to the discovery of patterns in large and complex data sets is called data mining.',
    description2: 'The reason why I decided to choose to implement data mining techniques for my bachelorâ€™s thesis is because I believe that this field is extremely important nowadays due to the overwhelming increase in the amount of data available online.',
    description3:' I consider that being able to collect, clean and interpret information available on the Internet is of great importance for any data scientist or programmer because drawing insights from data sets can help in achieving both personal and professional goals. ',
    description4: 'For developing the web application, I decided to create it in such a way so that even beginners in the field are able to easily grasp the concepts related to data mining. Additionally, the users are able to not only learn about this field, but also visualize the implementation of certain techniques on data that can be acquired either independently, or through the presented web scraping process. Moreover, I believe that small to medium sized companies could greatly benefit from the use of this application due to the fact that observing modifications in data like price evolution of competitors is vital for companies to survive in different markets.',
